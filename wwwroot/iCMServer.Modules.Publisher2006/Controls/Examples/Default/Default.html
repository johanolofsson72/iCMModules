<p>
	The major highlight of the Q1 2006 release is the “ajaxification” of all 
	telerik ASP.NET UI controls - the out-of-the-box capability of telerik controls 
	to initiate AJAX requests and update other controls on the page, or to get 
	updated by a callback control. This unique interoperability is made possible 
	with the new patent-pending technology of the telerik AJAX panel implemented in 
	r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> v2.0. The new AJAX panel replaces the postback 
	behavior of asp.net controls without breaking the page life-cycle. Our 
	technology allows you to “ajaxify” not only the telerik controls but also ANY 
	standard asp.net control without having to write complex Java Script code.
</p>
<p>
	telerik r.a.d.<strong>tabstrip</strong> v3.0 is another landmark release in Q1 
	2006. The product’s rendering was completely re-engineered and v3.0 is the 
	first implementation of a semantic navigational control for ASP.NET. Using 
	telerik’s unique patent-pending technology, r.a.d.<strong>tabstrip</strong> renders 
	as a set of list items rather than through tables or DIVs and its output was 
	trimmed by more than 70%. All future major versions of telerik navigational 
	controls will also start to use the new rendering technology and allow 
	customers to benefit from the most optimized menu, panel and treeview controls.
</p>
<p>
	r.a.d.<strong>controls</strong> Q1 2006 also introduces a major update of 
	telerik’s award-winning HTML WYSIWYG editor. r.a.d.<strong>editor</strong> v6.0 
	offers great performance enhancements and is faster and lighter than ever 
	before - the component now uses AJAX in all file browser dialogs. The ability 
	to load files and folders on demand greatly improves the usability of the 
	component and it also re-affirms the product’s robustness for enterprise 
	applications with large file repositories.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to the 3 major updates and minor updates to the grid, combobox and 
	treeview products, r.a.d.<strong>controls</strong> Q1 2006 also includes an 
	important update for r.a.d.<strong>calendar</strong>. The new v 1.5 adds a date 
	picker control to the calendar and customers will no longer have to write code 
	to implement advanced date picking functionality using r.a.d.<strong>calendar</strong>.
