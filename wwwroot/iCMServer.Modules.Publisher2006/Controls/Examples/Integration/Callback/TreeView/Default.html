	This example demonstrates integration between r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> controls 
	suite and r.a.d.<strong>treeview</strong>. You can manage the state and 
	appearance of r.a.d.<strong>treeview</strong> through AJAX-enabled controls.
</p>
<p>In this example you can also drag&amp;drop nodes between the two treeview 
	instances by using the generic r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> control.
