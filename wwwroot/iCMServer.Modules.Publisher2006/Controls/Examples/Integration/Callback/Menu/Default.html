<p>
	This example demonstrates integration between r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> controls 
	suite and r.a.d.<strong>menu</strong>. You can manage the state and appearance 
	of r.a.d.<strong>menu</strong> through AJAX-enabled controls.
</p>
<p>Beside the standard actions on the menu (add/remove items, rebind from different 
	data source), you can use r.a.d.<strong>menu</strong> to populate other 
	controls on the page by using the generic callback control. In the example, you 
	can select <em>Xml File </em>data source from the <em>Rebind</em> listbox and 
	use r.a.d.<strong>menu</strong> to add or remove items in the <em>Shopping Cart</em>.
