<p>This example demonstrates how to create dynamic wizard-like forms
using r.a.d.<strong>tabstrip</strong> and the r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> controls. 
<br />
The form can become callback-enabled by simply replacing an asp button control with 
the r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> CallbackButton control.
