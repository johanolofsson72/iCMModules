	This example demonstrates integration between r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> controls 
	suite and r.a.d.<strong>dock</strong>. You can manage the state and appearance 
	of r.a.d.<strong>dock </strong>through AJAX-enabled controls.</p>
<p>With r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> controls you can update&nbsp;any 
	control&nbsp;on the page either in a dockable object or outside of it. The 
	callback controls can be used from inside a dock template.</p>
<p>In the example you can&nbsp;save multiple docking configurations on the server 
	and later reload them.
