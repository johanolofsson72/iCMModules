This example demonstrates integration between r.a.d.<strong>grid</strong> and 
r.a.d.<strong>tabstrip</strong> using r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong> controls. 
The example shows how to modify a grid and a tabstrip using callbacks. All data 
manipulation is done on the server, minimizing the need for javascript code.<br />
You can add and remove items from the shopping cart. In addition you can 
display information about a particular item in the tabstrip.
