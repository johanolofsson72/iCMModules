	This example demonstrates integration between r.a.d.<strong>callback</strong>, 
	r.a.d.<strong>combobox</strong> and the new r.a.d.<strong>input</strong> and 
	r.a.d.<strong>calendar</strong> controls. Seamless integration between the 
	calendar and input controls creats a sophisticated date picking control. The 
	different search options are loaded dynamically from separate user controls, 
	which reduces the overall size of the form.
